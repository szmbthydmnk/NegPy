# The Pipeline

Here is what actually happens to your image. We apply these steps in order, passing the buffer from one stage to the next.

## 1. Geometry (Straighten & Crop)
**Code**: `negpy.features.geometry`

*   **Rotation**: We spin the image array (90° steps) and fine-tune with affine transformations. We use bilinear interpolation so it stays sharp.
*   **Autocrop**: I try to detect where the film ends and the scanner bed begins by looking for the density jump. It's not perfect (light leaks or weird scanning holders can fool it), so there's a manual override.

**Note:** Cropping happens early because the normalization step needs to know what is "image" and what is "border" to calculate the black/white points correctly. Instead of cropping you can also use the "Analysis buffer" option to exclude outer X% of the image from the analysis. This is useful when you have a border around the film.

## 2. Scan Normalization
**Code**: `negpy.features.exposure.normalization`

*   **Physical Model**: We treat the input as a **radiometric measurement**. Pixel values represent linear transmittance captured by the sensor.
*   **Log Conversion**: Film density is logarithmic ($D \propto \log E$). We convert the raw signal to log-space to align with the physics of the film layers:
    $$E_{log} = \log_{10}(I_{raw})$$
*   **Bounding & Polarity**:
    The engine uses statistical percentiles to detect the usable signal range. To maintain a unified pipeline, we always map the target **White Point** to the **Floor** ($0.0$) and the **Black Point** to the **Ceiling** ($1.0$).
    *   **Negative (C-41/B&W)**: Raw low-signal (Film Base) maps to Floor ($0.0$). Raw high-signal (Highlights) maps to Ceiling ($1.0$). Range: 0.5% to 99.5%.
    *   **Positive (E-6)**: Raw high-signal (Highlights) maps to Floor ($0.0$). Raw low-signal (Shadows) maps to Ceiling ($1.0$). Range: 99.9% to 0.01%.
*   **White & Black Point Offsets**: Allows manual adjustment of the normalization boundaries. Shifting the White Point floor or Black Point ceiling enables precise highlight recovery or shadow crushing without re-running statistical analysis.
*   **Stretch**: All modes use independent channel bounding. This neutralizes the orange mask in negatives and base tints/fading in reversal film by stretching each channel to the full $[0, 1]$ range.

## 3. The Print (Exposure)
**Code**: `negpy.features.exposure`

*   **Virtual Darkroom**: Simulates shining light through the normalized log-signal onto paper.
*   **Color Timing**: Applies subtractive filtration (CMY) in log-space. This mimics a dichroic head on an enlarger. Adjustments can be targeted to **Global**, **Shadows**, or **Highlights** regions using Gaussian-weighted tonal masks.
*   **The H&D Curve**: Models paper response using a **Logistic Sigmoid**:
    $$D_{print} = \frac{D_{max}}{1 + e^{-k \cdot (x_{adj} - x_0)}}$$
    *   $D_{max}$: Deepest black the paper can do.
    *   $k$: Contrast grade.
    *   $x_0$: Exposure time (pivot).
    *   $x_{adj}$: Adjusted input logarithmic exposure.
*   **Toe & Shoulder**: Independent sigmoid-weighted masks control how density transitions into deep shadows (toe) and how it compresses in highlights (shoulder). The masks are derived from the log-exposure distance from the pivot, ensuring the effect is naturally weighted to the tonal range:
    $$x_{adj} = x - \Delta_{toe} \cdot \text{mask}_{toe} + \Delta_{shoulder} \cdot \text{mask}_{shoulder}$$
*   **Output**: Converts print density back to light (Transmittance):
    $$I_{out} = 10^{-D_{print}}$$
    *   **Note**: Final display gamma (2.2) is applied in the final output stage.

The defaults should be somewhat neutral, but you can (and should) use the sliders to match the curve shape (your "print") to your liking.

## 4. Retouching
**Code**: `negpy.features.retouch`

This stage removes physical artifacts like dust, hairs, and scratches from the negative. We use two complementary approaches:

*   **Automatic Dust Removal**:
    A resolution-invariant impulse detector and patching engine.
    
    1.  **Statistical Gating**: Uses dual-radius analysis. A local window ($3\times$ scaled) identifies luminance spikes, while a wide window ($4\times$ scaled) provides texture context. A cubic variance penalty ($w\_std^3$) aggressively raises detection thresholds in high-frequency regions (foliage, rocks) to minimize false positives.
    2.  **Peak Integrity**: Validates candidates via a strict 3x3 Local Maximum check and a $Z > 3.0$ sigma outlier gate. A strong-signal bypass ensures saturation-limited artifacts (hairs/scratches) are captured even if they form plateaus.
    3.  **Annular Sampling (SPS)**: Background data is reconstructed via Stochastic Perimeter Sampling. Samples are fetched from a ring strictly exterior to the artifact footprint, ensuring zero contamination from the dust luminance itself.
    4.  **Soft Patching**: Healed regions are integrated using distance-weighted alpha blending with cubic falloff and procedural grain injection to match local noise characteristics.

*   **Manual Healing (Stochastic Boundary Sampling - SBS)**:
    When you use the Heal tool, we fill the brush area using information from its own perimeter.
    
    1.  **Perimeter Characterization**: The tool identifies the cleanest background luminance at the edge of the brush circle. This sets a "Perimeter-Safe" floor to prevent dark artifacts in bright areas like skies.
    2.  **Stochastic Sampling**: For every pixel inside the brush, we sample the immediate boundary with small angular jitter:
        $$I_{patch} = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{j=1}^{3} \text{min3x3}(P_{θ + Δ θ_j})$$
        *   $P_{θ + Δ θ_j}$: Perimeter point at pixel's angle $θ$ with random jitter $Δ θ$.
        *   This reconstructs the natural grain and texture of the surrounding area without using "synthetic" noise.
    3.  **Luminance Keying**: To preserve original details and grain within the brush, we only apply the patch to pixels that are significantly brighter than the reconstructed background:
        $$m_{luma} = \text{smoothstep}(0.04, 0.12, I_{curr} - I_{patch})$$
    4.  **Cumulative Patching**: Patches can be overlaid and stacked. The tool intelligently heals long hairs or scratches by basing each new patch on the current accumulated state.

*   **Resolution Independence**:
    Retouching coordinates and sizes are scaled relative to the full-resolution RAW data, ensuring that edits made on the preview translate perfectly to the high-resolution export.

## 5. Lab Scanner Mode
**Code**: `negpy.features.lab`

This mimics what lab scanners like Frontier or Noritsu do automatically. For maximum signal quality, the steps are applied in the following sequence:

1.  **Chroma Denoise**: Applies a Gaussian filter to the A and B channels in LAB space. This reduces color noise and digital "chroma speckle" while leaving the L-channel (and its film grain) completely untouched.
2.  **Color Separation**: We use a mixing matrix to push colors apart. It mixes between a neutral identity matrix and a mode-specific "calibration" matrix based on how much pop you want.
  
    $$M = \text{normalize}((1 - \beta)I + \beta C)$$
    *   $I$: Identity matrix (neutral).
    *   $C$: Calibration matrix.
    *   $\beta$: Separation strength.

3.  **Vibrance**: Selectively boosts the saturation of muted colors using a chroma mask. The mask is strongest at zero chroma and fades to zero for already vibrant colors, preventing over-saturation of sensitive areas like skin tones.
4.  **Global Saturation**: A linear boost applied to all colors via the HSV saturation channel.
5.  **CLAHE**: Adaptive histogram equalization. It boosts local contrast in the luminance channel.
  
    $$L_{final} = (1 - \alpha) \cdot L + \alpha \cdot \text{CLAHE}(L)$$
    *   $L$: Luminance channel.
    *   $\alpha$: Blending strength.

6.  **Sharpening**: We sharpen just the Lightness channel ($L$) in LAB space using Unsharp Masking (USM). We apply a threshold to avoid amplifying noise.

    $$L_{diff} = L - \text{GaussianBlur}(L, \sigma)$$
    $$L_{final} = L + L_{diff} \cdot \text{amount} \cdot 2.5 \quad \text{if } |L_{diff}| > 2.0$$
    *   $\sigma$: Blur radius (scale factor).
    *   $2.5$: Hardcoded USM boosting factor.
    *   $2.0$: Noise threshold.

7.  **Glow**: Simulates lens bloom by blurring highlights and compositing them back using screen blending.

    $$I_{out} = 1 - (1 - I)(1 - B_{glow} \cdot s_{glow})$$
    $$B_{glow} = \text{GaussianBlur}(I \cdot m_{hl})$$

    *   $m_{hl}$: Luminance-based highlight mask, quadratically ramped from 50% to 100%.
    *   Applied equally to all three channels.

8.  **Halation**: Simulates the red scatter caused by light reflecting back through the film base. Uses a larger-radius Gaussian than Glow and a strongly red-biased highlight source.

    $$I_{out} = 1 - (1 - I)(1 - B_{hal} \cdot s_{hal})$$
    $$B_{hal} = \text{GaussianBlur}(I_R \cdot m_{hl} \cdot C_{hal})$$

    *   $I_R$: Red channel used as the scatter source.
    *   $C_{hal}$: Per-channel tint weights $(1.0,\ 0.3,\ 0.05)$ for red-dominant scatter.

## 6. Toning & Paper Simulation
**Code**: `negpy.features.toning`

*   **Paper Tint**: We multiply the image by a base color (e.g., warm cream for fiber paper) and tweak the D-max (density boost).
  
    $$I_{tinted} = (I_{in} \cdot C_{base})^{γ_{boost}}$$
    *   $I_{in}$: Input image.
    *   $C_{base}$: Paper tint RGB color.
    *   $γ_{boost}$: D-max density boost.

*   **Chemical Toning**: We simulate toning by blending the original pixel with a tinted version based on luminance ($Y$) masks.
    *   **Selenium**: Targets the shadows (inverse squared luminance).
      
        $$m_{sel} = S_{sel} \cdot (1 - Y)^2$$
        $$I' = I_{tinted} \cdot (1 - m_{sel}) + (I_{tinted} \cdot C_{selenium}) \cdot m_{sel}$$
        *   $Y$: Pixel Luminance.
        *   $S_{sel}$: Selenium strength.
        *   $C_{selenium}$: Selenium target color (purple/reddish).
    *   **Sepia**: Targets the midtones using a Gaussian bell curve centered at $0.6$ luminance.
      
        $$m_{sep} = S_{sep} \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{(Y - 0.6)^2}{0.08}\right)$$
        $$I_{out} = I' \cdot (1 - m_{sep}) + (I' \cdot C_{sepia}) \cdot m_{sep}$$
        *   $S_{sep}$: Sepia strength.
        *   $C_{sepia}$: Sepia target color (brown/gold).
